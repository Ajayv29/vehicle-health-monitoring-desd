# 🚗 IoT-Based Vehicle Health Monitoring and Driver Alert System

An IoT-enabled system designed to monitor real-time vehicle health parameters and driver conditions, and provide instant alerts to prevent accidents and reduce maintenance costs.


## 📌 Overview

Modern vehicles generate vast amounts of data, but drivers often remain unaware of critical issues.  
This project presents an **IoT-Based Vehicle Health Monitoring and Driver Alert System** that continuously monitors vehicle status, analyzes data, and notifies users in real time.

The system integrates multiple sensors with a microcontroller and cloud platform to enable remote monitoring and driver alerts.



## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor essential vehicle parameters in real time  
- Detect abnormal conditions and potential failures  
- Provide audible and visual alerts  
- Upload data to the cloud for remote access and analysis  



## 🔧 Features

- Real-time engine temperature monitoring  
- oil level monitoring   
- Driver drowsiness detection  
- Cloud dashboard  
- email alerts  

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32 / ESP8266)  
- Temperature Sensor    
- LCD Display  
- Buzzer
- vibration sensor
- Power Supply  


## 💻 Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE  
- Embedded C / C++  
- IoT Platform (ThingSpeak / Firebase / Blynk)  


## ⚙ Working Principle

1. Sensors collect vehicle and driver data  
2. Microcontroller processes the data  
3. If abnormal value detected → Alert generated  
4. Data uploaded to cloud  
5. User monitors remotely  


## 📊 Output

- Live sensor values on LCD  
- Buzzer alerts during danger  
- Real-time cloud graphs  


## 🚀 Applications

- Smart vehicles  
- Fleet management  
- Accident prevention  
- Predictive maintenance  



## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- GPS tracking  
- Mobile application  
- AI-based fault prediction  
- Camera-based monitoring
